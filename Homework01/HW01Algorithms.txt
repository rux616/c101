1) We want to know how many cubic feet, or the volume, are in a rectangular solid of a given Height, Width,
  and Length. ( Hint , the Height, Width and Length are inputs to problem, and the cubic foot is the
  output, and number of cubic feet is equal to Length times Width times Height )

[Inputs]
Height
Width
Length

[Outputs]
Volume

[Equations]
Volume = Height * Width * Length

[Limits]
Height > 0
Width > 0
Length > 0

[Algorithm]
output "Enter height: "
input Height
output "Enter width: "
input Width
output "Enter length: "
input Length
if (Height > 0 AND Width > 0 AND Length > 0) then
	output "Volume: ", Height * Width * Length
else
	output "Sorry, all values must be greater than 0."
end if



2) Given the Radius (R) of a circle you want to calculate the Area (A) and Circumference (C) of that
   circle. The equations are for Area, A = pi*R^2 and Circumference, C = 2*pi*R.

[Inputs]
Radius

[Outputs]
Area
Circumference

[Equations]
Area = PI * Radius * Radius
Circumference = 2 * PI * Radius

[Limits]
Radius > 0

[Algorithm]
output "Enter radius: "
input Radius
if (Radius > 0) then
	PI = 3.14159265359
	output "Area: ", PI * Radius * Radius
	output "Circumference: ", 2 * PI * Radius
else
	output "Sorry, the radius must be greater than 0."
end if



3) User enters an integer and problem tells user if the number is between 1 and 100, and if it is then
   display “Good Input”, else displays “Bad Input”.

[Inputs]
Number

[Outputs]
"Good Input"
"Bad Input"

[Equations]
Number >= 1
Number <= 100

[Limits]
Number == Integer

[Algorithm]
output "Please enter a number between 1 and 100: "
input Number
if (Number >= 1 AND Number <= 100) then
	output "Good Input"
else
	output "Bad Input"
end if



4) A problem that will convert a total number of days into the corresponding number of years and days left
   over. For example, if you enter 1254 days, then it would display “3 years and 159 days”. (Hint, there
   are 365 days in one year, and use the / (div) and % (mod) operators)

[Inputs]
NumberOfDays

[Outputs]
Years
DaysLeft

[Equations]
Years = NumberOfDays div 365
DaysLeft = NumberOfDays mod 365

[Limits]
NumberOfDays >= 0
NumberOfDays == Integer

[Algorithm]
output "Enter number of days: "
input NumberOfDays
if (NumberOfDays >= 0) then
	output NumberOfDays div 365, " years and ", NumberOfDays mod 365, " days"
else
	output "Sorry, you can't have a negative number of days."
else if



5) A problem that determines if an entered number is negative or positive, and continues to have user enter
   numbers and display appropriate response until user enters a zero. Will keep looping until the user
   enters 0.

[Inputs]
Number

[Outputs]
"Positive"
"Negative"

[Equations]
Number > 0
Number < 0

[Limits]
Stop at Number == 0

[Algorithm]
do
	output "Please enter a number: "
	input Number
	if (Number > 0) then
		output "Positive"
	else if (Number < 0) then
		output "Negative"
	end if
while (Number != 0)



6) A problem that has user continue to enter weight of people and keeps a running total weight of all the
   people and also keeps track of the number of people entered. This will continue until a weight entered
   is less then or equal to zero. Problem will then display the average weight of all the people.

[Inputs]
Weight

[Outputs]
AverageWeight

[Equations]
AverageWeight = TotalWeight / NumberOfPeople

[Limits]
Stop at Weight <= 0

[Algorithm]
do
	output "Enter weight: "
	input Weight
	if (Weight > 0) then
		TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight
		NumberOfPeople++
	end if
while (Weight > 0)
output "Average weight: ", TotalWeight / NumberOfPeople
