5) Workers at a company have won a 7.6% annual pay increase, which will be retroactive for six months.
   Write an algorithm, then a program, that takes an employee's previous annual salary as input, and
   outputs the amount of retroactive pay due to the employee, the new annual salary, and the new monthly
   salary.  Test program with following three salaries of $35,000, $46,500, and $52,450.  Output from the
   program should look close to the following and should have $ sign as well:

Please enter employee's salary --> 35000

Retroactive Pay    --> $1330
New Annual Salary  --> $37660
New Monthly Salary --> $3138.33

[Inputs]
OldAnnualSalary

[Outputs]
RetroactivePay
NewAnnualSalary
NewMonthlySalary

[Equations]
NewAnnualSalary = OldAnnualSalary * 1.076
NewMonthlySalary = NewAnnualSalary / 12.0
RetroactivePay = (NewAnnualSalary - OldAnnualSalary) / 2.0

[Limits]
OldMonthlySalary >= 0

[Algorithm]
output "<Description/Instructions>"
output "Please enter employee's salary --> "
input OldAnnualSalary

if (OldAnnualSalary >= 0) then
	NewAnnualSalary = OldAnnualSalary * 1.076
	NewMonthlySalary = NewAnnualSalary / 12.0
	RetroactivePay = (NewAnnualSalary - OldAnnualSalary) / 2.0
	
	output "Retroactive Pay    --> $", RetroactivePay
	output "New Annual Salary  --> $", NewAnnualSalary
	output "New Monthly Salary --> $", NewMonthlySalary
else
	output "Sorry, you can't have a negative salary."
end if



6) All years that are evenly divisible by 400 are always a leap year.  They are also a leap year if they
   are evenly divisible by 4 AND are not evenly divisible by 100.  For example, 1600 was a leap year
   because it is evenly divisible by 400.  Likewise 1988 was a leap year because it was evenly divisible by
   4 AND not evenly divisible by 100.  Write an algorithm to solve this problem for entering any year,
   providing a positive integer.

[Inputs]
Year

[Outputs]
IsLeapYear

[Equations]
Year mod 4
Year mod 100
Year mod 400

[Limits]
Year > 0
Year == Integer

[Algorithm]
output "<Description/Instructions>"
output "Enter a year: "
input Year

if (Year > 0) then
	if (Year mod 400 == 0 OR (Year mod 4 == 0 AND Year mod 100 != 0))
		output Year, " is a leap year"
	else
		output Year, " is not a leap year"
	end if
else
	output "Sorry, you can't have a negative year."
end if



7) A problem that has a user enter positive numbers and keeps record of how many even numbers are entered.
   When user enters 0 problem stops and then displays the number of even numbers entered.  For example, if
   user enters 3, 56, 4, 13, 779, 46 and 0, then problem would display something like "User entered 3 even
   numbers".  You need to use a loop structure for this one.

[Inputs]
Number

[Outputs]
NumberOfEvens

[Equations]
Number mod 2

[Limits]
Number == Integer
Stops when Number == 0

[Algorithm]
output "<Description/Instructions>"

do
	output "Enter a number: "
	input Number

	if (Number > 0) then
		if (Number mod 2 == 0) then
			NumberOfEvens++
		end if
	else if (Number < 0) then
		output "Please enter positive numbers."
	end if
while (Number != 0)

output "User entered ", NumberOfEvens, " even number(s)"
