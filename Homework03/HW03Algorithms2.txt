4) A store is having a sale on shirts.  The shorts cost $15.75 individually, but if four to ten shirts are
   bought they are only $12.50 a shirt, and if more than ten are purchased then they cost only $8 a shirt.
   Have the problem calculate the price for all the shirts, the sales tax (at 6%), and the total price
   based on the number of shirts purchased.  At least one of your inputs should test the number of shirts
   at 9.  Also make sure to display all the data.  i.e. shirts sold, price of shirts, sales tax and total
   price.

[Inputs]
NumberOfShirts

[Outputs]
NumberOfShirts
PriceOfShirts
SalesTax
TotalPrice

[Equations]
PriceOfShirts = NumberOfShirts * PricePerShirt
SalesTax = PriceOfShirts * SALES_TAX
TotalPrice = PriceOfShirts + SalesTax

[Limits]
NumberOfShirts >= 0 (Not Tested)

[Algorithm]
SALES_TAX = 0.06
output "<Description and Instructions>"
output "Please enter the number of shirts you wish to buy: "
input NumberOfShirts

if (NumberOfShirts < 4) then
	PricePerShirt = 15.75
else if (NumberOfShirts <= 10) then
	PricePerShirt = 12.5
else
	PricePerShirt = 8
end if

PriceOfShirts = NumberOfShirts * PricePerShirt
SalesTax = PriceOfShirts * SALES_TAX
TotalPrice = PriceOfShirts + SalesTax

output "Number of shirts purchased: ", NumberOfShirts
output "Price of shirts: $", PriceOfShirts
output "Sales tax: $", SalesTax
output "Total price: $", TotalPrice



5) Solve a problem that has the user continually entering integers, one at a time, and assume these
   integers are in the range of 0 to 10, but don't test for this, and calculates their sum until the sum is
   over 35.  When done the sum and last numbered entered should be displayed.  You will need to use a loop
   of some kind for this one.

[Inputs]
Number

[Outputs]
Sum
Number

[Equations]
Sum += Number

[Limits]
Stop when Sum >= 35

[Algorithm]
Sum = 0
output "<Description and Instructions>"

do
	output "Enter a number between 0 and 10: "
	input Number
	Sum += Number
while (Sum < 35)

output "Sum = ", Sum
output "Last Number = ", Number
