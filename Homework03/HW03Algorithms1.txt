3) Write just a program that will accept any two integers in the range -180 to 180, make sure to test first
   that input is in this range.  The program will then display the product and then the division of these
   two numbers.  The division will show the quotient and remainder.  The output needs to look as close as
   possible to the example below.  Turn in test runs with numbers of 125 and 34, then test 157 and 16.

	Enter two integers between -180 and 180 --> 125  34

	  125           3 R 23
	x  34         _____
	-----      34|125
	 4250

[Inputs]
Number1
Number2

[Outputs]
Product
Quotient
Remainder

[Equations]
Product = Number1 * Number2
Quotient = Number1 div Number2
Remainder = Number1 mod Number2

[Limits]
-180 <= Number1 <= 180
-180 <= Number2 <= 180

[Algorithm]
output "Enter two integers between -180 and 180 --> "
input Number1, Number2

if ((-180 <= Number1) AND (Number1 <= 180) AND (-180 <= Number2) AND (Number2 <= 180)) then
	Product = Number1 * Number2
	Quotient = Number1 div Number2
	Remainder = Number1 mod Number2

	output Number1, "\t\t" Quotient, " R ", Remainder
	output "x", Number2, "\t\t_____"
	output "-----\t\t", Number2, "|", Number1
	output Product
end if
